# Elite Dangerous: AutoPilot
Elite Dangerous computer vision based autopilot version 2

Program uses openCV and other tools in python to navigate automatically in Elite Dangerous.

Look [here for the autopilot alpha version release](https://github.com/skai2/EDAutopilot/releases).

## Usage:
Currently non-functional

## Necessary Setup:
In game, you must have configured keyboard keys for all of the following. You may configure them in either
the left or the right slot, and this program will automatically fetch your most recent changes.
  * In 'Flight Rotation':
    * Yaw Left
    * Yaw Right
    * Roll Left
    * Roll Right
    * Pitch Up
    * Pitch Down
  * In 'Flight Throttle':
    * Set Speed To 0%
    * Set Speed To 100%
  * In 'Flight Miscellaneous'
    * Toggle Frameshift Drive
  * In 'Mode Switches':
    * UI Focus
  * In 'Interface Mode':
    * UI Panel Up
    * UI Panel Down
    * UI Panel Left
    * UI Panel Right
    * UI Panel Select
    * UI Back
    * Next Panel Tab
  * In 'Headlook Mode':
    * Reset Headlook

## Optimal Game Settings:
1. Game resolution:      1080p Borderless
2. Ship UI color:        Orange (default colour)
3. Ship UI brightness:   Maximum

## General Guidelines

I recommend setting your route finder to use only scoopable stars. For full functionality, "Advanced Autodocking" module must be outfitted on ship. Definitely do not leave this running unsupervised unless you don't mind paying rebuy.

Or if you'd like to set it up and run the script directly...
